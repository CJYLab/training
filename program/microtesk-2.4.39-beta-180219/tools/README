To generate test data based on constraints, MicroTESK requires external
constraint solvers. The current version supports the
Z3 (https://github.com/z3prover) and  CVC4 (http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu) constraint
solvers. Constraint executables should be downloaded and placed to
the <installation dir>/tools directory.

1. Windows users should download Z3 (32 or 64-bit version) from the following
   page: http://z3.codeplex.com/releases and unpack the archive to the

# Description:
#
# This test template demonstrates how MicroTESK handles endless loops in test
# templates. If an endless loop is detected, MicroTESK halts generating a test
# program. A template is considered containing an endless loop, if the number of
# times an instruction call is executed exceeds the allowed limit.
